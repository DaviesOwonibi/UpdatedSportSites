# Updated Sport Sites
While browsing the Nike website, I noticed how cluttered it felt. At its core, it is an online store, but I strongly believe that shopping online can be transformed into an enjoyable experience with an exciting site design. As a result, I decided to revamp the homepage for both Nike and Adidas.

About the Project:
The main goal of this project was to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing homepage for two popular brands, Nike and Adidas. I aimed to declutter the interface and make the online shopping experience more engaging and enjoyable for users.
